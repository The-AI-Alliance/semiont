/**
 * Detection budget derivation — pure window arithmetic over the inference
 * provider's published limits. No hand-tuned chunk constants, no density or
 * yield modeling: document content never enters this arithmetic. The guard
 * for the pathological tail (a chunk whose annotation JSON still overflows
 * the output budget) is the per-chunk fail-loud `max_tokens` throw in the
 * callers, not a prediction here.
 *
 * Provider shapes (see `@semiont/inference` interface.ts):
 * - Shared window (Ollama): the provider publishes
 *   `maxOutputTokens === contextTokens` — prompt and response share one
 *   `num_ctx`. What remains after the prompt scaffold is split
 *   input:output = 1:2 (annotation JSON echoes each span plus a fixed
 *   key/context envelope, so output needs the larger share). The 1:2 ratio
 *   is the plan's one allocation policy — doc-independent, tuned only on
 *   live evidence.
 * - Separate ceilings (Anthropic): output takes its full ceiling and input
 *   gets the rest of the window. For realistic documents the input bound is
 *   enormous and no chunking occurs.
