**Making meaning from resources through actors, context assembly, and relationship reasoning.**

This package implements the actor model from [ACTOR-MODEL.md](../../docs/system/ACTOR-MODEL.md). It owns the **Knowledge Base** and the seven actors that serve it.

Five **access actors** mediate every read and write — the bus-facing interface of the Knowledge Base:

- **Stower** (write) — the single write gateway to the Knowledge Base; handles all resource and annotation mutations and job lifecycle events
- **Browser** (read) — handles all KB read queries: resources, annotations, events, annotation history, referenced-by lookups, entity type and tag-schema listing, and directory browse (merging filesystem listings with KB metadata)
- **Gatherer** (context assembly) — assembles gathered context for annotations (`gather:requested`) and resources (`gather:resource-requested`); searches vectors for semantically similar passages (adds `semanticContext` to `GatheredContext`)
- **Matcher** (search/link) — context-driven candidate search with multi-source retrieval, composite structural scoring, and optional LLM semantic scoring
- **CloneTokenManager** (yield) — manages clone token lifecycle for resource cloning

Two **projection pipelines** follow the event log to keep the eventually-consistent read models in sync — addressed by no one, replying to nothing:

- **Graph Consumer** (project) — subscribes to graph-relevant domain events and projects them into the graph database; carried on the KB record (`kb.graphConsumer`) and rebuilt from the event log at startup (`rebuildAll()`)
- **Smelter** (embed) — standalone embedding pipeline run via `@semiont/make-meaning/smelter-main` (not started by `startMakeMeaning`); subscribes to domain events, reads content from the KB working tree via `WorkerContentTransport`, chunks text, embeds via `@semiont/vectors`, and indexes into the vector store (Qdrant). On startup it reconciles Qdrant against the KS catalog — re-embedding what's missing or stale (every upsert is stamped with the embedded bytes' checksum, so changed content is detected) and deleting orphans — so a wiped Qdrant volume, or events missed while the worker was down, recover by restarting the smelter

(The third derived read model — the materialized views — is not pipeline-maintained: the EventStore's `ViewManager` materializes views synchronously inside `appendEvent()` for a read-your-writes guarantee.)

All seven actors subscribe to the EventBus via RxJS pipelines and expose no public business methods — only `initialize()` and `stop()`, plus a startup recovery entry point on the pipelines (`rebuildAll()` / `reconcile()`). Callers communicate with the access actors by putting events on the bus.

The EventBus is a **complete interface** for all knowledge-domain operations. HTTP routes in the backend are thin wrappers that delegate to EventBus actors. The `@semiont/http-transport` exposes the same operations via verb-oriented namespaces (`semiont.browse`, `semiont.mark`, `semiont.gather`, etc.).

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @semiont/make-meaning
```

### Start Make-Meaning Service

```typescript
import { startMakeMeaning } from '@semiont/make-meaning';
import { SemiontProject } from '@semiont/core/node';
import { EventBus } from '@semiont/core';
import type { Logger } from '@semiont/core';

// EventBus is created outside make-meaning — it is not encapsulated by this package
const eventBus = new EventBus();
const project = new SemiontProject('/path/to/project');

// Start all infrastructure
const makeMeaning = await startMakeMeaning(project, config, eventBus, logger);

// Access components
const { knowledgeSystem, jobQueue } = makeMeaning;
const { kb, stower, browser, gatherer, matcher, cloneTokenManager } = knowledgeSystem;

// Graceful shutdown
await makeMeaning.stop();
```

This single call initializes:
- **KnowledgeSystem** — groups the Knowledge Base and its actors
  - **KnowledgeBase** — groups EventStore, ViewStorage, WorkingTreeStore, GraphDatabase, GraphDBConsumer, and optionally VectorStore
  - **Stower** — subscribes to write commands on EventBus
  - **Browser** — subscribes to all KB read queries and directory browse requests on EventBus
  - **Gatherer** — subscribes to annotation and resource gather requests on EventBus; searches vectors for semantically similar passages
  - **Matcher** — subscribes to candidate search requests on EventBus
  - **CloneTokenManager** — subscribes to clone token operations on EventBus
- **JobQueue** — background job processing queue + job status subscription
- **Bus command handlers** — request-channel translators registered via `registerBusHandlers`

It does **not** start the Smelter (a standalone process — `@semiont/make-meaning/smelter-main`) or the job workers (the worker process in [@semiont/jobs](../jobs/) — see [Job Workers](./docs/job-workers.md)).

### Gather Context (via EventBus)

```typescript
import { firstValueFrom, race, filter, timeout } from 'rxjs';

const correlationId = crypto.randomUUID();

// Emit gather request for an annotation
eventBus.get('gather:requested').next({
  correlationId,
  annotationId,
  resourceId,
  options: { contextWindow: 1000 },
});

// Await result
const result = await firstValueFrom(
  race(
    eventBus.get('gather:complete').pipe(filter(e => e.correlationId === correlationId)),
    eventBus.get('gather:failed').pipe(filter(e => e.correlationId === correlationId)),
  ).pipe(timeout(30_000)),
);
```

## Architecture

### Actor Model

All meaningful actions flow through the EventBus. The KB actors are reactive — they subscribe via RxJS pipelines in `initialize()` and communicate results by emitting on the bus.

### Knowledge System and Knowledge Base

The **Knowledge System** binds the Knowledge Base to its actors. Nothing outside the Knowledge System reads or writes the Knowledge Base directly.

The **Knowledge Base** is an inert store — it has no intelligence, no goals, no decisions. It groups five core subsystems and one optional one:

| Store | Implementation | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Event Log** | `EventStore` | Immutable append-only log of all domain events |
| **Materialized Views** | `ViewStorage` | Denormalized projections for fast reads (materialized synchronously on append) |
| **Content Store** | `WorkingTreeStore` | Working-tree files addressed by URI |
| **Graph** | `GraphDatabase` | Eventually consistent relationship projection |
| **Graph Consumer** | `GraphDBConsumer` | Event-to-graph projection pipeline (one of the two pipeline actors; carried on the KB record because `createKnowledgeBase()` constructs and starts it) |
| **Vectors** *(optional)* | `VectorStore` | Semantic vector index (Qdrant + memory) via `@semiont/vectors` |

Its sibling pipeline, the Smelter (event-to-vector projection), is **not** a KB member — it runs as a standalone process via `@semiont/make-meaning/smelter-main`.

```typescript
import { createKnowledgeBase } from '@semiont/make-meaning';

const kb = await createKnowledgeBase(eventStore, project, graphDb, eventBus, logger, options);
// kb.eventStore, kb.views, kb.content, kb.graph, kb.graphConsumer
// kb.vectors (optional), kb.projectionsDir
```

### EventBus Ownership

The EventBus is created by the backend (or script) and passed into `startMakeMeaning()` as a dependency. Make-meaning does not own or encapsulate the EventBus — it is shared across the entire system.

### Pure projection validators

The dispatcher in [`src/handlers/job-commands.ts`](src/handlers/job-commands.ts) does projection-validated job creation: when a `mark.assist` (linking) or `yield.fromAnnotation` job arrives with `entityTypes`, the dispatcher validates that every tag is registered; when a tagging job arrives with a `schemaId`, the dispatcher resolves it against the registered tag-schema set.

Both rules are pure functions in [`src/views/projection-validators.ts`](src/views/projection-validators.ts):

- `resolveTagSchema(schemas, schemaId)` → `{ schema } | { error }` — id lookup with the standard "Tag schema not registered" / "tag-annotation requires schemaId" error formats.
- `validateEntityTypes(registered, requested)` → `{ ok: true } | { ok: false; unknown }` — set membership check that lists the offending tags in caller order.

The dispatcher is the I/O shell: read the projection (via the readers in `src/views/`), pass it to the validator (pure), then either stash the resolved value or rethrow as `job:create-failed`. Validator unit tests run in single-digit milliseconds with no filesystem, no event-bus, no mock JobQueue — the dispatcher integration tests in `__tests__/handlers/job-commands.test.ts` keep the wiring covered.

This pattern (functional core, imperative shell) is shared with `@semiont/event-sourcing`'s projection reducers; see [`docs/system/PROJECTION-PATTERN.md`](../../docs/system/PROJECTION-PATTERN.md) for the architectural narrative, the full axiom catalog, and guidance for adding new validators.
