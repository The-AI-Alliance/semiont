## Security Checklist
**Required for all PRs that modify authentication, authorization, or admin functionality:**

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] No authentication logic moved to client-side
- [ ] All admin routes properly protected with server-side checks
- [ ] JWT tokens validated server-side only
- [ ] Session data comes from secure sources (database, not client claims)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials

### Admin Route Security (Frontend)
- [ ] Admin routes use `AdminAuthWrapper` or equivalent server-side protection
- [ ] No admin content rendered for unauthorized users
- [ ] Access denied pages return 200 OK (not 307 redirects)
- [ ] No sensitive information in error responses
- [ ] Authentication checks use `getServerSession`

### API Security (Backend)
- [ ] Admin endpoints protected with `adminMiddleware`
- [ ] All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes (401/403/500)
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Database queries protected behind authentication
- [ ] Input validation implemented

### Information Disclosure Prevention
- [ ] No database connection strings in error messages
- [ ] No file paths or stack traces exposed to clients
- [ ] No user emails or personal data in unauthorized responses
- [ ] No API keys or secrets in client-accessible responses
- [ ] Error messages are generic and safe

## Testing
- [ ] Added tests for new functionality
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Security tests pass (`npm run test:security`)
- [ ] Manual testing completed for authentication flows
- [ ] Tested with different user roles (unauthenticated, non-admin, admin)

## Security Test Results
Please run and paste results:

### Frontend Security Tests
```bash
cd apps/frontend && npm run test:security
# Paste results here
```

### Backend Security Tests  
```bash
cd apps/backend && npm run test:security
# Paste results here
```

### Manual Security Verification
If you modified admin routes, please verify:

```bash
# Start the application and test:
curl -I http://localhost:3000/admin
# Should return: HTTP/1.1 200 OK (not 307)

# Verify no admin content leakage:
curl -s http://localhost:3000/admin | grep -i "admin\|dashboard\|management"
# Should return no results
```

## Performance Impact
- [ ] No significant performance degradation
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] No N+1 query problems introduced
- [ ] Bundle size impact considered (for frontend changes)
