/**
 * Command Type Definitions â†’ Type definitions only
 * 
 * This module contains ONLY type definitions and minimal constants.
 * It answers the fundamental question: "What shape should things have?"
 * 
 * Contents:
 * - Type definitions for command functions
 * - Core platform command constants (used by handlers)
 * - No behavior, no discovery logic, no business rules
 * 
 * Why this exists:
 * - Provides TypeScript type safety across the codebase
 * - Defines contracts that commands and handlers must follow
 * - Avoids circular dependencies by being a leaf module
 * 
 * This module should NEVER import from other modules in core/
 * (except other pure type modules like command-results.ts)
