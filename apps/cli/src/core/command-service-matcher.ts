/**
 * Command-Service Matcher Module â†’ Which work together?
 * 
 * This module determines which commands can operate on which services.
 * It answers the fundamental question: "Can this command work with this service?"
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Matches commands with compatible services based on capabilities
 * - Resolves "all" to the list of applicable services for a command
 * - Validates that a service supports a given command capability
 * - Contains the business rules for service capabilities
 * 
 * Business Rules (should eventually move to service definitions):
 * - Only frontend/backend services can be "published" (containerized services)
 * - Only database/filesystem services can be "backed up" or "restored"
 * - Most other commands work with all services
 * 
 * This module bridges command-discovery and service-discovery,
 * applying the business logic to determine valid combinations.
