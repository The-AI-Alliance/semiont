## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Ways to Contribute

1. **Add platform support** (highest priority - see below)
2. **Fix bugs** - Check [Issues](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/issues)
3. **Improve documentation** - Clarify, expand, or fix docs
4. **Write tests** - Increase coverage
5. **Review pull requests** - Help review community contributions
6. **Report bugs** - Create detailed issue reports
7. **Suggest features** - Start a [Discussion](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/discussions)

### Before Starting Work

**For major features or platforms:**
1. Open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/discussions) to discuss the approach
2. Get feedback from maintainers before investing significant time
3. Create an issue to track the work

**For bug fixes and small improvements:**
- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Create an issue describing the problem
- Reference the issue in your PR

## üõ† Development Workflow

**Most contributors will work from a fork.** Only a small number of maintainers have direct push access to the main repository.

### 1. Work in Your Fork

If you haven't already forked the repository (see [Initial Setup](#initial-setup) above):

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/semiont.git
cd semiont

# Add upstream remote to track main repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont.git
```

### 2. Create a Branch

Create a feature branch in your fork:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/gcp-platform
# or
git checkout -b fix/database-migration-bug
# or
git checkout -b docs/improve-api-reference
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `test/` - Test improvements
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `platform/` - New platform implementations

### 3. Make Changes

- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Follow [TypeScript strict mode](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict)

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific service tests
npm run test:backend
npm run test:frontend

# Type check
npm run type-check

# Lint
npm run lint
```

### 5. Commit Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Add GCP deployment support"
git commit -m "Fix database connection timeout in CLI"
git commit -m "Clarify authentication flow in API docs"
```

### 6. Sync with Upstream

Before pushing, sync with the main repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 7. Push to Your Fork and Create PR

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/gcp-platform
```

Then create a Pull Request from your fork to `The-AI-Alliance/semiont:main` on GitHub.

**For maintainers with push access:** You may push branches directly to the main repository, but pull requests are still required for code review.

## üåç Adding New Platform Support

**This is the most valuable contribution you can make!**

Platform contributions enable Semiont to run on new cloud providers and deployment targets. We have comprehensive guides for extending the CLI:

### Developer Guides

- **[Adding Platforms](apps/cli/docs/ADDING_PLATFORMS.md)** - Complete guide to implementing a new platform (GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.)
- **[Adding Services](apps/cli/docs/ADDING_SERVICES.md)** - Add new service types to the platform
- **[Adding Service Types](apps/cli/docs/ADDING_SERVICE_TYPES.md)** - Extend service type definitions
- **[Adding Commands](apps/cli/docs/ADDING_COMMANDS.md)** - Add new CLI commands

### Quick Overview

1. **Study existing platforms** in `apps/cli/src/platforms/` (AWS, Container, POSIX)
2. **Implement the Platform interface** for your target platform
3. **Add platform-specific resources** and deployment logic
4. **Write tests** for platform operations
5. **Document the platform** in `docs/platforms/YOUR_PLATFORM.md`

Follow the [Adding Platforms guide](apps/cli/docs/ADDING_PLATFORMS.md) for step-by-step instructions.

### Platform PR Checklist

When submitting a new platform:

- [ ] Platform implements complete `Platform` interface
- [ ] Unit tests for platform implementation (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for deployment workflow
- [ ] Documentation in `docs/platforms/PLATFORM.md`
- [ ] Updated main [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) with platform option
- [ ] Example environment configuration
- [ ] Cost estimation guidance
- [ ] Migration guide from existing platforms

### Platform Examples to Follow

Study existing platforms as reference:

- **[AWS](apps/cli/src/platforms/aws/)** - Most complete implementation (ECS, RDS, ALB, CloudFront)
- **[Container](apps/cli/src/platforms/container/)** - Docker/Podman abstraction
- **[POSIX](apps/cli/src/platforms/posix/)** - Local development platform

- **[Backend Testing Guide](apps/backend/docs/TESTING.md)** - Jest, unit tests, Prisma database tests
- **[CLI Testing Guide](apps/cli/TESTING.md)** - Platform tests, command tests, mocking

### Quick Start

**Run all tests:**
```bash
npm test
```

**Run service-specific tests:**
```bash
cd apps/backend && npm test     # Backend tests (Jest)
cd apps/frontend && npm test    # Frontend tests (Vitest)
cd apps/cli && npm test         # CLI tests
```

### Test Requirements for PRs

- ‚úÖ All existing tests must pass
- ‚úÖ New functionality must include tests
- ‚úÖ Aim for >80% coverage on new code
