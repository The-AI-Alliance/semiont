title: Semiont - Your Sovereign AI Knowledge Platform
---

## Semiont

**The open-source, future-proof framework that enables humans and intelligent agents to co-create shared knowledge — governed by you and built to last.**

Semiont is a standards-compliant multimedia resource management system built on the **W3C Web Annotation** model. It transforms unstructured content into interconnected semantic networks through collaborative markup, linking, and AI-powered knowledge extraction—all stored as standard, interoperable annotations.

### Why Semiont?

- **Standards-Based** - Built on W3C Web Annotation for long-term interoperability and data portability
- **AI-Native** - Designed from the ground up to work seamlessly with large language models and intelligent agents
- **Self-Sovereign** - Run on your infrastructure with your data — no cloud dependencies, no vendor lock-in
- **Future-Proof** - Open standards ensure your knowledge remains accessible regardless of technology changes

## AI-Powered Knowledge Management

### [Annotation Detection](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/blob/main/docs/ai/DETECTION.md)

Automatically detect and create semantic annotations including highlights, assessments, comments, tags, and entity references — turning raw content into structured knowledge.

### Entity Resolution

Link detected entities to specific resources or external knowledge bases, building a rich semantic network that connects related concepts across your entire knowledge system.

### Context Retrieval

Extract precise semantic context from your knowledge graph for LLM consumption, enabling AI assistants to reason over your specific domain knowledge.

### Contextualized Generation

Create new resources aligned with your existing knowledge, maintaining consistency and coherence across all AI-generated content.

## Use Cases

- **Research & Analysis** - Annotate papers, extract citations, track provenance of ideas
- **Documentation** - Build interconnected knowledge bases with semantic linking
- **Legal & Compliance** - Review contracts, track references, manage regulatory content
- **Content Curation** - Organize multimedia resources with rich semantic metadata
- **Collaborative Knowledge** - Teams working together to build shared understanding
