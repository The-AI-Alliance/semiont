## Semiont

**The open-source, future-proof framework that enables humans and intelligent agents to co-create shared knowledge — governed by you and built to last.**

Semiont is a standards-compliant multimedia resource management system built on the **W3C Web Annotation** model. It transforms unstructured content into interconnected semantic networks through collaborative markup, linking, and AI-powered knowledge extraction—all stored as standard, interoperable annotations.

**AI-Native Enhancements:**

- **Entity Detection** - Automatically identify people, places, concepts, and other entities
- **Entity Resolution** - Link detected entities to specific resources or external knowledge bases
- **Context Retrieval** - Extract semantic context from the knowledge graph for LLM consumption
- **Contextualized Generation** - Create new resources aligned with your existing knowledge

Use it as a Wiki, an Annotator, or a Research tool. Run it on your infrastructure with your data for true **sovereign AI**.
